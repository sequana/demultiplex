What is Sequana ?
=====================

**Sequana** is a versatile tool that provides

#. A Python library dedicated to NGS analysis (e.g., tools to visualise standard NGS formats).
#. A set of Pipelines dedicated to NGS in the form of Snakefiles
#. Standalone applications
    #. sequana_coverage ease the
       extraction of genomic regions of interest and genome coverage information
    #. sequana_taxonomy performs a quick
       taxonomy of your FastQ. This requires dedicated databases to be downloaded.
    #. Sequanix, a GUI for Snakemake workflows (hence Sequana pipelines as well)
